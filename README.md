# BingBac2
A Bing background wallpaper downloader

Based on a similar project called BingBackground but with no code reused, this has been completely rewritten in dotnet core as a personal project. The original bothered with things like getting lower resolution images for smaller screens, but I am not going to fuss with that because the max available from the Bing endpoint right now is 1920x1080 and that seems the minimum these days.

Currently downloads a file to the BingBac2 folder if you create it.

What's next? See "TODO"s in the code.
